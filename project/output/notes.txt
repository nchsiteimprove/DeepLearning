Cut data to 150 examples of each type, seed 1337, small network. Got convergence in epoch 33-39.
At 200 examples of each it converged at around epoch 47-55.
Used f1 + categorical_crossentropy fancy cost


Using just categorical_crossentropy the network converges around epoch 74 for 200 examples.
converges around epoch 47 for 150 examples

used learning rate 0.05

Now seeing small network converge around epoch 28-29 with learning rate 0.01, 150 examples

Increasing batch size makes convergence (of train acc) happen later

now using batch size 20

now halving learning rate every 10 epochs. convergence improved from ~49 to ~32-40

increased network size to 30
increased network size to 40 (converged at epoch 36)
increased network size to 50 (converged at epoch 27)
increased network size to 60 (converged at epoch 35)
